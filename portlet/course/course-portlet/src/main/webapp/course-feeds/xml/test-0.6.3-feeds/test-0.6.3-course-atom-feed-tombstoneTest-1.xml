This test feed is designed to test NTER's ability to handle feeds that have
tombstoned courses or course components.

test-0.6.2-course-atom-feed-tombstoneTest-0.xml : has a full listing of courses
test-0.6.2-course-atom-feed-tombstoneTest-1.xml : contains tombstoned courses
test-0.6.2-course-atom-feed-tombstoneTest-2.xml : contains course updates

To test:
1.  Process -0: Verify that three courses have been added
2.  Process -1: Verify that one of the courses and course component have been
        removed.  This should be done via the database manager.  Verify that a
        new course entry has been entered for a tombstone that did not match an
        existing course.
3.  Process -2:  Verify that the course tombstoned in -1 has been un-removed
        (since its updateDate is newer than the tombstone date) and that the
        empty course added in -1 has been fully filled in.
