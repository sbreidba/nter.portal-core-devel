This test feed is designed to test NTER's ability to tombstone student records.

This test suite is designed to work with the course ids found in
sample-0.6.1-course-atom-feed.xml, and as such, that file should be processed
before these tests are run.

test-0.6.1-student-records-atom-feed-tombstoneTest-0.xml - has full listing of student records
test-0.6.1-student-records-atom-feed-tombstoneTest-1.xml - has tombstoned listings
test-0.6.1-student-records-atom-feed-tombstoneTest-2.xml - has updated listings
test-0.6.1-student-records-atom-feed-tombstoneTest-3.xml - has updated listings with date OLDER than remove date
To Test:
1.  Process sample-0.6.1-course-atom-feed.xml to add a full listing of courses
2.  Process -0 to add a full listing of students and student records
3.  Process -1 and verify that student records have been removed.
4.  Process -2 and verify that the student record that was tombstone is removed.
5.  Process -3 and verify that the student record that was tombstone is not removed (reactivated).
